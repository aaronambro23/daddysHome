/// takes the whole middle underneath one compact toolbar.
///
/// ## Focus is not a mode
///
/// It used to be: drilling into an agent hid the rail outright, so the project
/// tree and every other agent's state disappeared exactly when you started
/// working. Now the rail is permanent and focusing an agent only changes what
/// occupies the space to the right of it. `store.detailAgentID` still means
/// "which agent the middle column is showing" — it just no longer takes the
/// window hostage.
///
/// ## Why this is a ZStack over a GeometryReader rather than an HStack
///
/// The terminal has to *move* between two places. Expressed as two branches of
/// an `if`, SwiftUI would tear down one `TerminalPane` and build another — and
/// `TerminalSurface` wraps a SwiftTerm `NSView`. On rebuild it replays
/// `PTYProcess.recentOutput`, but that buffer is capped at 200 lines, so a long
/// session would silently lose its scrollback every time you opened or closed
/// the detail view.
///
/// So there is exactly one `TerminalPane` in the hierarchy, always, and what
/// changes is the rectangle it is given. Same view, same NSView, no teardown —
/// and because it is a frame change rather than a branch, it genuinely slides.
