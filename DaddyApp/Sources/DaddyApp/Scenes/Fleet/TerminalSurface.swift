        // in between, and those rows are live in the buffer but outside the
        // rect, so they wait for the *next* tick. Hence the split, every time.
        //
        // Off, every repaint redraws the whole visible grid straight from the
        // buffer, so it cannot be half a frame behind. It costs redrawing ~40
        // rows of CoreText rather than a few; AppKit still coalesces to one
