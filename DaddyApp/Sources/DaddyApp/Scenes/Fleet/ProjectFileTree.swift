/// work for this. Finder puts `public.file-url` on the drag pasteboard, and
/// asking SwiftUI to decode that into a `URL` through `Transferable` silently
/// matched nothing — no targeting, no highlight, no drop. The rows looked inert

/// `onDrop(of: [.fileURL])` names the pasteboard type outright, which is what

/// `registerForDraggedTypes([.fileURL, …])` — and that path has always worked.
///
/// The URLs are then read straight off the drag pasteboard rather than through
/// `NSItemProvider`, because a provider only loads asynchronously and `perform`
/// has to answer immediately. The drag pasteboard is valid for the whole drop,
/// so it can just be read.
///
/// ## Why the targeting cannot be `onHover`
///
/// A hover callback fires for a *mouse* moving over a view, and during a drag
/// session AppKit is not sending those — the pointer belongs to the drag. The
