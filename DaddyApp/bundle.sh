# Builds Daddy.app — a real macOS application bundle.
#
# Why this exists: `swift build` produces a bare Unix executable. Run from a
# terminal, macOS never registers it as a foreground application — it inherits
# the terminal's activation context. The menu bar keeps saying "Terminal", and
# anything that pastes into "the focused app" (dictation, for one) pastes into
# the terminal instead of into Daddy. The app has to be a bundle with an
# Info.plist before the system will treat it as its own thing.
#
# Usage:  ./bundle.sh [debug|release]      (default: release)

# A stable signature, not an ad-hoc one.
#
# `--sign -` gave the bundle a fresh identity on every build, and the keychain
# binds its ACLs to that identity — so the Google Drive token prompted for the
# login password again after each rebuild, and "Always Allow" never survived.
# Touch ID has the same problem: a biometric ACL is pinned to the signature
# that created it. Signing with a real certificate is what makes both stick.
#
# Deliberately no `--options runtime`: the hardened runtime gates audio input,
# and this app records the microphone and runs speech recognition. Enabling it
# without `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` breaks voice capture, and it
# is only required for notarization — which a local personal build never does.
#
# Override with SIGN_IDENTITY to use a different certificate; falls back to
# ad-hoc so a machine without the cert still produces a runnable bundle.
