/// here is the tree itself and the row it is built from.
///
/// Two things it now does that it did not:
///
/// **It shows fewer projects.** `ProjectScanner` finds every directory under
/// `~/Documents` that looks like code, which is dozens, and most of them are
/// not things you are working on this month. The list is already sorted
/// most-recently-modified first, so the top eight are very nearly always the
/// answer; the rest are one click away and nothing is thrown out.
///
/// **It shows files.** Expanding a project used to reveal the one level of
/// subdirectories `ProjectScanner` happened to collect. With the rail pinned —
/// or with a file in flight over it — it now reveals what is actually there,
/// and `FileTreeStore` makes that renameable, deletable and droppable.
